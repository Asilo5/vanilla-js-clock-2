# JS Clock ‚è∞

Wanting to refresh my vanilla JavaScript skills, I decided to do Wesbos 30 day Vanilla JS challenge. For day 2, I built a simple clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With the transform style property being manipulated by JavaScript to get the right timing of the clock and its position on it!
